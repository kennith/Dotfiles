dotfiles
========

My dotfiles, hopefully it will run across all platform (unlikely).

# Installation

My idea of using dotfiles is instead of replacing the current existing dotfiles,
let each dotfile link from the home directory to the dotfiles that are checked
out into each machine. 

# TODO
Add a bash script to backup the current dotfiles and link the available 
dotfiles form home directory to the checkout path.
